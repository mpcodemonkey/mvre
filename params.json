  "body": "# MVRE\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nMVRE is a mobile virtual reality game engine built on top of WebGL and WebVR. Its purpose as of now is to show the extent to which the WebVR spec and WebGL 2.0 have matured, and to serve as an intermediate introduction for those looking to develop web-based VR games. Although the focus is on mobile, any game produced using this engine is (unless directly stated) playable on any desktop VR device.\r\n\r\nThis project is heavily based on the work done by Brandon Jones in his VR Presentation example. It uses webvr-polyfill by default until WebVR is enabled in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox by default.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\nCurrently, this is an extremely alpha demo of webvr using webgl 2.0. The demo draws a pyramid with vertex colors based off of vertex world coordinate positions. This demo works in Chrome and Firefox on desktop, as well as Firefox Aurora on android devices. In aurora, you will need to disable the VR DOM object for the polyfill to work.\r\n\r\n## Planned Features\r\n* To be announced\r\n\r\n## Completed Features\r\n* Validation of Webgl 2.0 support in WebVR\r\n* Simple Scenegraph\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nGame engine development is hard but rewarding. Never let the difficulty of a project be a roadblock that turns you away.",
